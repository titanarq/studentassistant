# Module: android

**Lives in:** `android/` (`:app`).

## Responsibility
Thin capture client (ADR-0001), Spanish UI:
- Pairing: scan the backend's QR (URL + one-time code), exchange for a token, store it in
  DataStore; several backends allowed; connection test.
- Home: subjects/topics from the backend, create topic, start or continue a session.
- Capture screen: CameraX preview, transcription with SpeechRecognizer (Google) sent as
  segments, or AudioRecord PCM16 streaming in server STT mode (ADR-0008), buttons (Capturar, Importante, Libro/Apuntes, Terminar), live transcript,
  pending-doubts counter, screen kept on.
- Still capture: burst of 3 full-resolution photos on button or `capture_now`; haptic + shutter
  sound; upload with retries; thumbnail strip.
- Offline resilience: local spool of audio and photos while disconnected, resumed by `seq`.

## Boundaries
- No study logic, no LLM calls, no vault access. Talks only the `protocol` contract.

## Tests
JVM unit tests for view models, protocol (shared examples), spool/retry logic with fakes.
